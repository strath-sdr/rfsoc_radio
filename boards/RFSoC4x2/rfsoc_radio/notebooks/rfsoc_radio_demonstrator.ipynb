    "## 2. The RFSoC Radio System <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"rfsoc-radio\"></a>\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate simple BPSK and QPSK data transmission using the RFSoC and PYNQ. Two hardware accelerators are provided; one to transmit data, and the other to receive data. Each accelerator is independant of one another and do not communicate. The transmitter modulates 100 kSa/s of data and it interpolates the signal to 1.024 GSa/s with subsequent interpolation stages. The RF DAC then transmits the data. The receiver is connected to the transmitter using an SMA loopback cable. The RF ADC will initially decimate the data and the receiver hardware accelerator will be responsible for synchronising to the signal and extracting the modulated data. The entire system can be seen in the [Figure 2](fig-2).\n",

    "### 2.1. Controlling the System <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"controlling-the-system\"></a>\n",
    "This demonstration provides a useful tool for interacting with the radio system. A radio dashboard, made entirely using the `ipywidgets` library, will allow you to change the mixer frequencies of the RF DAC and RF ADC. You can also choose to switch-off parts of the radio system such as the transmitter, and various parts of the receiver. You can load the radio dashboard by running the code cell below."

The transmission system uses a root raised cosine (RRC) to pulse-shape the modulated data, and then interpolates the samples to 1.024 GSa/s. The pulse-shaped, interpolated data is mixed with a carrier frequency and transmitted using the RF DAC. An overview of the transmitter can be seen in [Figure 3](fig-3).\n",

    "Before we continue to explore the receiver, the data frame created by the transmitter software wrapper should be described. Data frames are often required in communication systems as they allow the receiver to synchronise to the start of the payload (the data we would like to extract). Usually the transmitter sends a known sequence of bits, and these bits are detected in the receiver through correlation. In this system, the extended barker sequence [2] is used as the known sequence of bits for frame synchronisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the barker sequence, the transmitter must place other important information in a data frame before transmission. Some of these are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random data that allows the synchroniser to be exercised.\n",

    "The radio demonstration system uses a custom data frame. To keep things simple, the transmitter software wrapper only sends data frames that are 64 bytes long. This means that the frame is aligned to 4 bytes in memory, preventing unaligned access. The data frame format used by the demonstrator is shown in [Figure 4](fig-4).\n",

    "* Decimation\n",
    "* Coarse Frequency Synchronisation\n",
    "* Matched Filtering\n",
    "* Time and Phase Synchronisation\n",
    "* Frame Synchronisation\n",

    "\n",
    "The decimation stage significantly decreases the sample rate of the signal to 12.8MSa/s. Coarse frequency synchronisation is then performed correcting frequency offsets up to 1.6MHz. These frequency offsets must be larger than 195.3125Hz in order for the coarse frequency synchroniser to correct the signal. A matched root rasied cosine filter is then applied to the signal to suppress intersymbol interference. Time and phase synchronisation obtains the maximum effect points of the signal and decides whether the received signal is a binary 1 or 0. Finally, frame synchronisation is performed by correlating an extended barker sequence with the received binary data. This detects the start of the frame, which is transferred into system memory by the DMA.\n",
