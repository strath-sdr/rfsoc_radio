    "This notebook demonstrates a simple BPSK transceiver design for the RFSoC. Interactive plotting capabilities are provided so that users can visualise each stage of the BPSK synchronisation process. Users can transmit their own BPSK messages and receive them using a terminal. Furthermore, image data can also be transmitted and received using this system. Image transmission is accompanied by simple image display widgets for visualisation. To start using the BPSK demonstrator, follow the hardware and software setup instructions below.\n",

    "## RFSoC BPSK Radio <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"rfsoc-bpsk-radio\"></a>\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate simple BPSK data transmission using the RFSoC and PYNQ. Two hardware accelerators are provided; one to transmit data, and the other to receive data. Each accelerator is independant of one another and do not communicate. The transmitter modulates 100 kbits/s of data using BPSK, and it interpolates the signal to 1.024 MSa/s with subsequent interpolation stages. The RF-DAC then transmits the data. The receiver is connected to the transmitter using an SMA loopback cable. The RF-ADC will initially decimate the data and the receiver hardware accelerator will be responsible for synchronising to the signal and extracting the modulated data. The entire system can be seen in the [Figure 2](fig-2).\n",

    "A DMA controller is provided to transfer data from Jupyter Labs to the transmitter. Another DMA is provided to transfer data from the receiver to Jupyter Labs. Jupyter will be used to control the hardware accelerators and inspect the receiver's synchronisation stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlling the System <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"controlling-the-system\"></a>\n",
    "This demonstration provides a useful tool for interacting with the radio system. A radio dashboard, made entirely using the `ipywidgets` library. The radio dashboard will allow you to change the mixer frequencies of the RF DAC and RF ADC. You can also choose to switch-off parts of the radio system such as the transmitter, and various parts of the receiver. You can load the radio dashboard by running the code cell below."

    "* _**After you have executed the above cell, you should right click the radio dashboard, and select \"Create New View for Output\" from the drop-down menu. This will allow you to interact with the remainder of the notebook and retain access to the radio dashboard in another output view.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "The radio dashboard also reports the frequency offset that is corrected in the coarse frequency synchronisation stage. Be aware that the coarse frequency synchroniser can only correct 1.6MHz offsets. If the signal's offset frequency is larger than 1.6MHz, the reported frequency offset will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Transmitter <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"the-transmitter\"></a>\n",
    "The transmitter modulates 8-bit wide fixed point data into BPSK packets for transmission. Initially, the 8-bit wide data is serialised and modulated using BPSK. The transmission system uses a root raised cosine (RRC) to pulse-shape the BPSK data, and then interpolates the samples to 1.024 GSa/s. The pulse-shaped, interpolated BPSK data is mixed with a carrier frequency and transmitted using the RF DAC. An overview of the transmitter can be seen in [Figure 3](fig-3).\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that a DMA controller is provided to transfer data from Jupyter Labs to the transmitter. We can interact with the DMA through the `ol.transmitter` software wrapper by calling two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ol.transmitter.data(message)\n",
    "ol.transmitter.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method loads an ascii message into the transmitter's buffer. The second method will start the transmission. If you run these methods right now, you won't be able to see very much as we haven't prepared our receiver yet. Furthermore, the receiver will need support when trying to detect our transmitted signal. This support can be provided through frame based data transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frame Generation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"frame-generation\"></a>\n",
    "Before we continue to explore the receiver, the data frame created by the transmitter software wrapper should be described. Data frames are often required in communication systems as they allow the receiver to synchronise to the start of the payload (the data we would like to extract). Usually the transmitter sends a known sequence of bits, and these bits are detected in the receiver through correlation. In this system, the extended barker sequence [2] is used as the known sequence of bits for frame synchronisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the barker sequence, the transmitter must place other important information in a data frame before transmission. Some of these are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random data that allows the synchroniser to be exercised.\n",
    "* The extended barker sequence or known sequence of bits.\n",
    "* The frame number (if there are a series of frames transmitted sequentially).\n",
    "* The start flag indicating the first frame in the sequence.\n",
    "* The end flag indicating the last frame in the sequence.\n",
    "* The data frame length.\n",
    "* The payload.\n",
    "* Zero padding.\n",
    "* Anything else that is useful for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BPSK demonstration system uses a custom data frame. To keep things simple, the BPSK transmitter software wrapper only sends data frames that are 64 bytes long. This means that the frame is aligned to 4-bytes in memory, preventing unaligned access. The data frame format used by the BPSK demonstrator is shown in [Figure 4](fig-4).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fig-4\"></a>\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown, the data frame is exactly 64 bytes long. If the data frame uses less than 44 bytes of data for the payload, it is zero padded as required. Each of the data frame entries shown are used in this demonstration system.\n",

    "* Decimation\n",
    "* Coarse Frequency Synchronisation\n",
    "* Matched Filtering\n",
    "* Time and Phase Synchronisation\n",
    "* Frame Synchronisation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see each of these stages below in [Figure 5](fig-5). Notice that the final stage, frame synchronisation, is directly connected to a DMA controller. This allows the RFSoC's PL to transfer acquired BPSK frames into Jupyter Labs, via external memory.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The decimation stage significantly decreases the sample rate of the signal to 12.8MSa/s. Coarse frequency synchronisation is then performed correcting frequency offsets up to 1.6MHz. These frequency offsets must be larger than 1.5625kHz in order for the coarse frequency synchroniser to correct the signal. A matched root rasied cosine filter is then applied to the signal to suppress intersymbol interference. Time and phase synchronisation obtains the maximum effect points of the signal and decides whether the received signal is a binary 1 or 0. Finally, frame synchronisation is performed by correlating an extended barker sequence with the received binary data. This detects the start of the BPSK frame, which is transferred into system memory by the DMA.\n",
